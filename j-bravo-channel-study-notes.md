## Core Trading Strategy: "The Bravo Swing"

The flagship strategy taught across J Bravo's channel and courses. It is a **trend-following swing trading system** built on moving averages.

### Indicators Used

| Indicator | Type | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| **SMA 9** | 9-day Simple Moving Average | Primary entry signal line |
| **EMA 20** | 20-day Exponential Moving Average | Exit / stop-loss signal line |
| **SMA 180** | 180-day Simple Moving Average | Long-term trend direction |
| **VWAP** | Volume-Weighted Average Price | Institutional price levels / "GoGo Juice" signals |
| **MACD** | Moving Average Convergence Divergence | Trend identification and momentum |
| **RSI** | Relative Strength Index ("Really Simple Indicator") | Overbought/oversold conditions |
| **200 MA** | 200-day Moving Average ("The Important Little White Line") | Long-term trend alignment |

### Entry Rules

1. **Standard Buy Signal**: A **full candle closes above the SMA 9** — this indicates bullish momentum and a potential entry.
2. **Strong Buy Signal**: All three MAs are **sloping upward** and **aligned in order**: SMA 9 > EMA 20 > SMA 180. This confirms a strong uptrend.
3. **"GoGo Long" (Aggressive Entry)**: When **VWAP crosses above EMA 20**, J Bravo calls this the "GoGo Juice" — an aggressive long entry signal.

### Exit Rules

1. **Early Warning (Question Mark)**: A **green candle** closes below SMA 9 — signals possible bearish momentum, consider early exit.
2. **Standard Sell Signal**: A **price bar closes below the EMA 20** — this is the primary sell/exit trigger.
3. **Strong Sell Signal**: All three MAs are **sloping downward** and aligned in reverse order: SMA 180 > EMA 20 > SMA 9. This confirms a strong downtrend.
4. **"GoGo Short" (Aggressive Exit)**: When **VWAP crosses below EMA 20**, indicating bearish institutional flow.
5. **Hard Stop**: If holding through early signals, a **candle close below the EMA 20 is the definite exit point** — no exceptions.

### Visual Trend Confirmation

- **180-day MA color coding**: Gray during downtrends, white during uptrends
- **50-day MA** (optional): Used to identify conflicting trend signals between short and long-term trends

## Key Concepts & Terminology

### The 2% Rule
Never risk more than **2% of your total trading capital** on any single trade. Example: With a $50,000 account, maximum risk per trade = $1,000. This ensures a string of losses won't significantly drain the account and maintains psychological stability.

### Portfolio Heat Management
Monitoring the total risk exposure across all open positions. Related to the 2% rule but applied at the portfolio level.

### GoGo Juice
J Bravo's term for the aggressive entry/exit signal generated when **VWAP crosses the EMA 20**:
- VWAP crosses **above** EMA 20 = "GoGo Long"
- VWAP crosses **below** EMA 20 = "GoGo Short"

### Trailing Stop Loss
A dynamic stop-loss that moves upward as the price increases, locking in profits while allowing the trade to continue running. Used as part of the scaling exit strategy.

### MA Alignment / MA Order
The relative positioning of the three key moving averages determines trend strength:
- **Bullish alignment**: SMA 9 > EMA 20 > SMA 180 (all sloping up)
- **Bearish alignment**: SMA 180 > EMA 20 > SMA 9 (all sloping down)
- **Conflicting**: MAs are intertwined or not aligned — signals caution

### Full Candle Close
The Bravo Swing requires a **complete candle** (full bar) to close above/below the moving average — not just a wick or intraday touch. This filters out false signals.

## Trading Philosophy Summary

1. **Simplicity over complexity**: Focus on a small set of well-understood indicators rather than dozens
2. **Trend following**: Trade with the trend, not against it — confirmed by MA alignment
3. **Discipline**: Follow the system's entry/exit rules mechanically; don't override signals with emotion
4. **Risk management first**: The 2% rule and portfolio heat management keep you in the game long enough to become profitable
5. **Paper trade before real money**: Practice with simulated accounts to build confidence and refine execution
6. **Multi-timeframe awareness**: Analyze from yearly down to hourly charts for context
7. **Market psychology**: Understanding crowd behavior and emotional cycles in markets

## Critical Perspective

For balanced study, it's worth noting:
- The channel has faced criticism for prioritizing course monetization over free educational depth
- Some reviewers consider the paid courses overpriced relative to freely available trading education
- Trading strategies shown have inherent market risk; past performance does not guarantee future results
- Independent reviews should be consulted before purchasing any paid courses
- The Bravo Swing strategy, like all MA-based systems, can generate false signals in choppy/sideways markets
